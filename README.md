## Rentle coding exercise

### Introduction to the exercise

Welcome to Rentle's code exercise! We have tried to create an exercise that follows the main technologies that are currently in use at Rentle for you to see that with which kind of technologies we currently work with, and you could potentially too. We hope that you learn something new while doing this exercise.

We don't want that you feel overwhelmed about the amount of work you need to do for the exercise. It is okay to spend just a few hours for this, and we hope that you would not spend more than 8 hours. If you absolutely want to do more, then sure go ahead! But we don't expect it in any way. 

Also, if you do not have a lot of time available, you can also do only a subsection of the exercise, and write down how you would have done the other parts or extend your solution.

Remember, if there are any questions that come to your mind, or you face any issues that you are struggling with, you can always ask us for information or help.

### Project structure

The exercise project is created with `create-react-app-typescript`.
The main technologies used in the project are Typescript, React, Redux, React Router, Firebase and Material UI. For styling, the project uses JSS.

The project has a basic structure in place with examples of some views, components, actions and reducers.
There is a basic authentication logic in place and logic to fetch the correct shop and rentals data for the signed in user, in addition with some basic views and components done. If you have some issues, you can try to look for examples from these files.

The needed interfaces for Typescript types should also be in `common/types` and `services/types` files.

### Case description

Our imaginary pilot customer is a ski rental shop owner and super excited about Rentle, but he is really looking for a way to get good reports out of all the rentals that are made through the Rentle software.
For this requirement, the Rentle team formed a user story for the Reporting feature:

---

Our customer wants to get a reporting view of all the rentals that are going through the software.
The report should show all the completed rentals from the selected date ranges.
The report should also show data that is interesting for our customer, who is operating a rental business (such as amount of rentals, total revenue from the rentals, most popular products, average rental prices, average rental durations etc.)

---

A developer of the Rentle team was only able to create a dummy Report view that only fetches all the shop's rentals from the Firestore database, and lists them all to a simple HTML table. The Reports component was **not** optimally made, and the Reporting view is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the described user story.

### The content of the code exercise

Your task is to fulfill the requirements of the user story by modifying the Reports view (and other parts of the code if needed to structure your implementation).
To help you complete the task, Rentle team has listed some steps that should be in the final submitted version:

1. Create a component that allows the user to select a specific date range to view all the completed rentals from that date range. You can take advantage of other libraries or implement it by yourself, whichever you think is better.

   *Optional*: Edit the database fetching logic, so that you fetch only the rentals that you need to show in the UI based on the selected date range. (If you think of a case, where there is 10000 rentals, it is not very efficient to fetch all of them if the UI needs to show only 100)

2. Fulfill the requirements of the user story by adding more information to the reporting view. Think yourself in the shoes of the rental shop owner, and think which kind of data would be beneficial for them to see in order to improve their daily rental business. Moreover, take advantage of the Material UI library and improve the UI of your Reports view to make it easier to read and more informative (the final visual design of the Reporting view is not important, but focus more on the functionality).

3. Structure your code so that it follows React/Redux best practices.

4. Answer to the questions in the end of the readme-file after the other parts are done and before you submit your exercise.

### Running the exercise locally

1. Clone the code-exercise repository
2. In the root folder:

`npm install`


`npm start`



CLI should open your browser and the app should start running in localhost:8000

For the exercise, you can login with Rentle Shop user credentials:

Username: `rentleshop@rentle.io`

Password: `RentleShop`


We have added some mock rental data to Rentle Shop user that the project fetches from the database. You should use this data to complete the exercise.

### Submit instructions

Clone this repository and make all the changes to your own repository that you push to your own GitHub / other collaboration platform. You can push your result to a private or public repository.

When you are ready to submit, send us an email to `founders@rentle.io` to let us know that you have submitted the exercise. If the solution is in a public repository, give us the URL for the repository. If it is in a private repository in GitHub, invite also `tooga` GitHub username as a collaborator. If it is in some other platform, give us instructions on how to access your submitted solution.

Remember to answer to the questions in the readme. You can either send them to us in the submit email, or write them directly to your readme file.

### Additional information

When implementing the code exercise, there are no requirements to modify the already written code in other places than in the Reports view.
However, if you want to change the current code structure or change the existing code somehow, you are free to do so.

##### Typescript
You can see the data structure of the rentals from the `InStoreAPI` interface from the `common/types` file. The other needed data should also be already typed.
If you have issues with Typescript type errors, and cannot fix them, the last thing to fix them is to set the asked type as `any`. Then the Typescript will not give an error of the wrong type. Still, we encourage you not to use `any` types if you can.

### Contacting in case of errors or questions
If you encounter any issues or questions that you would need help with, or would help you to do the exercise, please be in contact with us.
We do not expect you to know everything in advance or to learn very complicated things for the sake of the exercise. Just like in a normal developing environment, if you encounter things that you need help with to proceed, send us an email to `founders@rentle.io` or contact `@toomask` in Telegram.

### Final questions to answer after submitting

- How many hours did you spend doing the assignment?

- Short summary of what you built, how, and why.

- Tell about your process: how did you get familiar with the existing code, where did you start first, which parts of the excercise did you focus on the most?

- Was there some parts of the exercise that were challenging, or you could not do? What took most of your time?

- If you had more time, what would you develop more for your Reporting view?

- Which technologies/libraries/frameworks in the coding exercise were new to you, and which were you already familiar with?

  - What was your first impression of the new technologies that you tried?

- Was there something in the database architecture of the rentals that was odd or that you would change to make it easier to compose data for the Reporting view?

- Any other comments about the existing code or about the exercise?

- Feedback to us: How did you like the coding excercise? What could we improve in it?# Rentle-coding-exercise
